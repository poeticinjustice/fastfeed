#Fast Feed

General: This project will begin a much larger evolutionary process. For now, the MVP:

The MVP will use a news api, https://newsapi.org/

####User Stories
_There will only be guest users for the MVP_

I want to go to a site and choose from a category of curated feeds, such as a tech category that includes the following sites: Ars Technica, Engadget, Hacker News, Recode, Tech Crunch, The Next Web and The Verge.

Once I choose a category, I want to receive a list of all the articles from the feeds in that category.

I also want to be able to see articles from a specific feed. For example, I would like to see the last five articles published by the Independent after choosing their feed.

If I click on an Article from any of the feeds, then I want the original page to pop up in a separate tab.

I want to be able to add and save the feed content of specific articles to favorites.

I want to delete articles that Iâ€™ve previously favorited.

Resources
For gitignore and as a general resource, I used my aggrenews project which relied on Bobby's express auth and jQuery help from Stack Overflow:
